To build animator:
  1) Install qt4 (including qt4-dev-tools)
  2) qmake NetAnim.pro (or qmake-qt4 NetAnim.pro)
  3) A Makefile should be created in the current directory
  4) Build with "make"
  5) Test animator with: ./NetAnim dumbbell.tr
                            or
                         ./NetAnim grid.tr


Compile Issues:
  If make fails, ensure that the qt4 version of qtmake is being used.  If you have 
  qt4 installed, but can't issue qmake command, it may need to be added to the path, 
  or simply specify the full path the the executable.
